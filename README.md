# flashcard-o-matic

An App Project made with React during the frontend module of Thinkful's Software Engineering Program.

The app is mobile friendly and responsive. Being user based means that everyone can study on this app plus anyone can create, edit, and delete decks and cards via forms.

Each deck must have at least 2 cards; each card - a front and a back. Once through a deck user will have the option to start over or route back to the home page.
